    // ---------------------- EXERCISE 1
    // Create an abstract class called MediaContent with 4 properties: title, releaseYear, genre, and rating
    // Add an abstract method: playContent() that needs to be implemented by subclasses
    // Create 3 classes (Movie, Series, and Documentary) that extend the MediaContent class
    //   - Movie class should have an additional property: director
    //   - Series class should have an additional property: seasons
    //   - Documentary class should have an additional property: subject
    // Each subclass should override the playContent() method to print a message specific to its type


    abstract class MediaContent(val title: String, val releaseYear: Int, val genre: String, val rating: Double) {
        abstract fun playContent()
    }


    class Movie(title: String, releaseYear: Int, genre: String, rating: Double, val director: String) : MediaContent(title, releaseYear, genre, rating) {

        override fun playContent() {
            println("Playing the movie '$title' directed by $director.")
        }
    }


    class Series(title: String, releaseYear: Int, genre: String, rating: Double, val seasons: Int) : MediaContent(title, releaseYear, genre, rating) {

        override fun playContent() {
            println("Playing the series '$title' with $seasons seasons.")
        }
    }


    class Documentary(title: String, releaseYear: Int, genre: String, rating: Double, val subject: String) : MediaContent(title, releaseYear, genre, rating) {

        override fun playContent() {
            println("Playing the documentary '$title' about $subject.")
        }
    }



    // ---------------------- EXERCISE 2
    // Create an interface called Account with 3 properties: accountNumber, accountHolder, and balance (Double)
    // Add methods: deposit(amount: Double), withdraw(amount: Double), and checkBalance() that need to be implemented by classes
    //      checkBalance should return a Double
    // Create 3 classes (SavingsAccount, CurrentAccount, and BusinessAccount) that implement the Account interface
    //   - SavingsAccount should have an additional property: interestRate
    //   - CurrentAccount should have an additional property: overdraftLimit
    //   - BusinessAccount should have an additional property: businessName
    // Each class should implement the methods to manage deposits and withdrawals with specific rules for each account type
    //      This means that for the CurrentAccount class, the withdraw function will be successful as long as
    //          the amount is less than or equal to the sum of the balance and overdraftLimit
    //      Should you try to withdraw more money than allowed, it should print: "Insufficient funds"
